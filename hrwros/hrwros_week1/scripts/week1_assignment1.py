# Assignment 1 for Week1: In this assignment you will subscribe to the topic that
# publishes sensor information. Then, you will transform the sensor reading from
# the reference frame of the sensor to compute the height of a box based on the
# illustration shown in the assignment document. Then, you will publish the box height
# on a new message type ONLY if the height of the box is more than 10cm.

# All necessary python imports go here.
